# Java-Polymorphic-Car-Example
This Java program demonstrates polymorphism through inheritance and method overriding.

The Car class serves as the base class with attributes representing a generic car. Subclasses Toyota and Ford inherit from Car and provide specific implementations for the accelerate method.

Polymorphism is evident in the accelerate method, where the behavior differs between instances of Toyota and Ford compared to the base Car class. Despite being invoked through the same method name, the behavior is determined by the actual type of the object.

In the Main class, polymorphism is showcased when Toyota and Ford objects are treated as Car objects, allowing for flexibility and code reusability.

To observe polymorphism in action, compile the Main.java file and execute it.
